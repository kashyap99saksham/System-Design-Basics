Two types of scaling we have :


1. HORIZONTAL - 0 0 0 0 0 (Multiple Machines)
  a. Load Balancing Required
  b. Resilient (Good)
  c. Network call betweek machines (Bad)
  d. Data Inconsistency (Bad)
  e. Scales Well, As users increases (Good)


2. VERTICAL - 0 (A bigger Machine)
              0
              0
  a. No Load Balancing Required
  b. Single Point of Failure (Bad)
  c. Inter Process Communication (Good)
  d. Data Consistent (Good)
  e. Hardware limit (Bad)



- For less user base, prefer to use vertical scaling.
- As user increases we can try to use Both types of scaling by picking advantages from both types of scaling.
